    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Neutral Valuation has profoundly influenced the field of mathematical finance. The pioneering work of Bachelier laid the groundwork for subsequent researchers, including Black, Scholes, and Merton, whose contributions have shaped modern financial theory. Today, these mathematical foundations are integral to the models used for pricing derivatives on the trading floors of banks, asset management firms, and other financial institutions. Concurrently, Python has emerged as the most prevalent language for implementing these models. This paper demonstrates how to build pricers for both vanilla and exotic options using object-oriented programming in Python. The classes developed in this paper leverage Monte Carlo simulation and geometric Brownian motion as the underlying stochastic processes to provide accurate and efficient pricing solutions.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Neutral Valuation marks a significant milestone in mathematical finance, tracing back to Bachelier's pioneering work, and subsequently refined by Black, Scholes, and Merton. This approach underpins the pricing models for derivatives widely used across financial institutions. With Python's growing popularity in the financial sector, this project showcases the implementation of option pricers using object-oriented programming.\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric Brownian Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is the stochastic process used to model the underlying asset's price dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Simulation is a computational algorithm that uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, often used in option pricing to simulate the various paths an asset price might take."

    "Conclusion\n",
    "This project presents a comprehensive pricing library for European plain vanilla and exotic options using Monte Carlo simulation and geometric Brownian motion as the stochastic process. The key components of the library include classes for risk-neutral discounting, modeling option parameters, and pricing various types of options such as European vanilla, lookback, and Asian options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Contributions\n",
    "Risk-Neutral Discounting:\n",
    "\n",
    "The library incorporates a robust risk-neutral discounting mechanism. This fundamental concept is essential for present value calculations of future cash flows under the risk-neutral measure, ensuring that the pricing models adhere to the no-arbitrage condition.\n",
    "Parameter Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "The library provides a flexible framework for defining the parameters of the underlying asset and options. This includes initial asset value, volatility, time-to-maturity, strike price, option type (call or put), and dividends. Such flexibility allows the library to accommodate a wide range of market scenarios and financial instruments.\n",
    "Monte Carlo Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the library is the Monte Carlo simulation technique, which is used to model the stochastic behavior of asset prices. By simulating numerous paths of the asset price under geometric Brownian motion, the library can accurately estimate the expected payoff of various options.\n",
    "The use of Monte Carlo simulation allows for the pricing of options with complex features and path dependencies, such as Asian and lookback options, which are difficult to price using closed-form analytical solutions.\n",
    "Geometric Brownian Motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The library employs the geometric Brownian motion model to describe the dynamics of the underlying asset price. This model captures the essential characteristics of asset price movements, including the drift (representing the expected return) and volatility (representing the risk or uncertainty).\n",
    "The stochastic differential equation underlying geometric Brownian motion ensures that the simulated asset prices are consistent with the theoretical assumptions of continuous-time finance.\n",
    "Pricing Exotic Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "The library extends the pricing capabilities to exotic options such as lookback and Asian options. Lookback options, which depend on the maximum or minimum asset price during the option's life, provide valuable insights for investors seeking to hedge against extreme market movements.\n",
    "Asian options, which depend on the average asset price, are particularly useful in markets where the underlying asset is subject to significant price fluctuations. The library's ability to price these options enhances its applicability to a broader range of financial instruments.\n",
    "Practical Implications\n",
    "The developed pricing library has significant practical implications for financial institutions, asset managers, and risk managers. By providing a versatile and accurate tool for option pricing, the library facilitates better decision-making and risk management. The use of Monte Carlo simulation and geometric Brownian motion ensures that the pricing models are robust and reflective of real-world market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Enhancements\n",
    "While the current version of the library offers a solid foundation for option pricing, several enhancements could further improve its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Computing: Implementing parallel computing techniques could significantly reduce the computational time required for Monte Carlo simulations, especially for large-scale simulations with high accuracy requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Stochastic Models: Incorporating advanced stochastic models, such as stochastic volatility models (e.g., Heston model) or jump-diffusion models, could provide more accurate pricing for options in markets with volatility clustering or sudden price jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration and Validation: Developing methods for calibrating the model parameters to market data and validating the pricing models against observed option prices could enhance the accuracy and reliability of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interface: Creating a user-friendly interface or integrating the library with financial software platforms could make it more accessible to practitioners in the finance industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates the successful development of a pricing library for European plain vanilla and exotic options using Monte Carlo simulation and geometric Brownian motion. The library's flexibility, accuracy, and robustness make it a valuable tool for option pricing and risk management. By addressing the practical needs of financial professionals and offering opportunities for future enhancements, this project contributes to the advancement of quantitative finance and financial engineering."
